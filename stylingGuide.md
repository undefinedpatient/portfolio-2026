# Styling Guide
This portfolio used both trandition `CSS` and `tailwind` styling.

## Current Approach
Use `tailwind` only for one time use element, or minor tweak.

Use `CSS` for base case styling, also reusable components.
For `CSS` styling not applying to element itself but instead of classes, the class name must have element name as prefix (.a-animated-underline), except for reusable components, where they will have dedicated css.
